Project Report for Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer sentiment from product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The primary goal is to classify each review into one of three categories: positive, negative, or neutral. This classification helps in understanding customer satisfaction and can guide business strategies.

Data Description
The dataset used in this project is a collection of product reviews. Each entry in the dataset includes the following fields:

- Id: Unique identifier for the review
- ProductId: Identifier for the product
- UserId: Identifier for the user
- ProfileName: Profile name of the user
- HelpfulnessNumerator: Number of users who found the review helpful
- HelpfulnessDenominator: Number of users who indicated whether they found the review helpful
- Score: Rating between 1 and 5
- Time: Timestamp for the review
- Summary: Brief summary of the review
- Text: Text of the review

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: The raw data is preprocessed to clean and prepare text data for analysis. This includes converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation and stopwords, and tokenizing the text.
2. Sentiment Analysis: The VADER sentiment analysis tool is used to compute sentiment scores for each review. Based on these scores, reviews are categorized as positive, negative, or neutral.
3. Visualization: Visualizations are generated to display the distribution of sentiments across the reviews and to explore the relationship between product scores and sentiment.

Results
The sentiment analysis classified the reviews as follows:

Positive: 519,568
Negative: 37,633
Neutral: 11,253

Visualizations provided insights into the distribution of sentiments and their correlation with product scores.

Challenges and Learnings
Handling large datasets required efficient data processing techniques.
The nuances of human language necessitated careful tuning of the NLP model.

Future Work
Improve the accuracy of the sentiment analysis model by incorporating more sophisticated NLP techniques.
Analyze the impact of review sentiments on product sales.

This project demonstrates the power of NLP in extracting meaningful insights from raw text data. The findings can help businesses understand customer sentiments and tailor their products and services accordingly.
